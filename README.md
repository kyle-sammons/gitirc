# Git IRC
What's Git IRC? It's an IRC-like client that's backed by Git. The general mapping is as follows:

* Servers -> Repositories
* Messages -> Commits
* Users -> Authors
* Channels -> Branches

Now you can have all of your conversations completely publicly and very slowly, but based on a sweet ass DAG.

# ... Why?
'Cause why not, that's why.
